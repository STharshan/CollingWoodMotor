      "Excellent service, my son and I both use Collingwood Motors, can often fit you in at short notice. They fixed an issue on my car so quickly, they actually took a video to show me that the job was done. Definitely recommend and easy to get to. Bus routes nearby if you need to drop your car off too.",

      "Used to go to Collingwood Motors years ago but then moved away and had to go elsewhere. Have moved back locally and I’m so glad! Took my new car for its major service and MOT, really really reasonable prices and I can actually tell it’s been taken care of. Staff are always so friendly and lovely. Hoping I stay local enough to use for life as I don’t trust my car anywhere else. Cannot recommend this garage enough. Thank you Simon & the Collingwood gents 💛",

Honestly and reliability is what matters to us and that’s why we return every year. Highly recommend",

They took good care of my Mini, and I'd not hesitate to recommend them.`,
